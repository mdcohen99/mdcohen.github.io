It isn’t even close for the team with the most losses in the history of the sport at a Division I level. So given the rare opportunity we have to discuss Hoosier football glory, let’s see just how good Indiana has been relative to a league that has produced the last two national champions and three of the last four teams to play in the national title game (Indiana beat two of those teams during the span of this dataset).\nOkay maybe this is actually a fan blog.\nLet’s look first at which Big Ten teams had the best scoring offenses in each of the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Let’s start with 2024. And yes, I made sure to check Indiana’s branding guide for the correct crimson color hex code.\n\n\nCode\nbigten2024 |&gt; \n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt; \n  summarize(points_per_game = mean(Points, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(points_per_game)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, points_per_game), y = points_per_game)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#990000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Indiana leads Big Ten scoring offenses in 2024... by a lot\", subtitle = \"Five Big Ten surpassed 30 point per game averages in the 2024 season.

That’s the clear leader among Big Ten teams (for what it’s worth, that was also second best nationally behind Miami — and nothing at all went wrong for Miami in 2024 obviously!). The next closest is Ohio State at 35.69. That’s certainly a notable gap!\nShould we mention that Ohio State still beat Indiana and went on to win the national championship? I guess that’s probably important to note that scoring a lot of points doesn’t make you the BEST team. But it doesn’t hurt!\nNow let’s look at 2025. What changed, if anything?\n\n\nCode\nbigten2025 |&gt; \n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt; \n  summarize(points_per_game = mean(Points, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(points_per_game)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, points_per_game), y = points_per_game)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#990000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"New faces join the Big Ten's top scoring offenses.\", subtitle = \"USC currently leads the Big Ten in scoring offense, but some less regarded teams like Nebraska have made big surges in 2025 compared to a season ago.

The sport is often defined by wacky, high-speed spread offenses or teams that seem not be aware the forward pass exists (talking about you Iowa!).\nHere, we’re going to look at one very specific (or well, not so specific these days) region of college football: The Big Ten.\nThese days, with the league stretching from coast to coast, there are many different stylistic and strategic choices made in building an offense. No longer is the Big Ten just a grind-it-out, physical, running league. Well, okay not Iowa again, but point stands.\nBecause there are so many styles and speeds of offense, does it matter how many plays you run in a game? Does running a lot of plays mean you are a good team? Let’s use the data to find out.\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\nLoading required package: sysfonts\n\nLoading required package: showtextdb\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlogs2024 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs24.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 1717 Columns: 79\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (11): Location, Opponent, Result, OT, Bowl.x, TeamURL, Outcome, Bowl.y,...\ndbl  (64): Rk, Gtm, Points, PointsOpp, PassCmp, PassAtt, PassPct, PassYds, P...\nlgl   (3): Score, TeamScore, OpponentScore\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nlogs2025 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs25.csv\")\n\n\nRows: 711 Columns: 77\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (9): Location, Opponent, Result, OT, TeamURL, Outcome, Team, Conferenc...\ndbl  (64): Rk, Gtm, Points, PointsOpp, PassCmp, PassAtt, PassPct, PassYds, P...\nlgl   (3): Score, TeamScore, OpponentScore\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\nbig10 &lt;- c(\"Nebraska Cornhuskers\", \"Iowa Hawkeyes\", \"Minnesota Golden Gophers\", \"Illinois Fighting Illini\", \"Northwestern Wildcats\", \"Wisconsin Badgers\", \"Indiana Hoosiers\", \"Purdue Boilermakers\", \"Ohio State Buckeyes\", \"Michigan Wolverines\", \"Michigan State Spartans\", \"Penn State Nittany Lions\", \"Rutgers Scarlet Knights\", \"Maryland Terrapins\", \"Washinton Huskies\", \"UCLA Bruins\", \"USC Trojans\", \"Oregon Ducks\")\n\n\nbigten2024 &lt;- logs2024 |&gt;

First, we’ll look at the 2024 season alone, then 2025 (so far) alone and then lastly, a combined chart.\nWe’ll have to look at this two ways each year. First total plays for the season and then try to standardize it for average per game since not every team played the same number of games.\n\n\nCode\nb1g2024plays |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, totalplays), y = totalplays, fill = TeamFull)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#db7069\") +\n  labs(title = \"Teams with deep playoff runs ran the most total plays. That makes sense!\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Total Plays\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 9.5, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, family = \"montserrat\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nb1g2024plays |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, avgplays), y = avgplays, fill = TeamFull)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#db7069\") +\n  labs(title = \"But running a lot of plays doesn't equal team success\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Plays per game\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, family = \"montserrat\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"), \n        axis.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shouldn’t come as much of a surprise to see Ohio State, Penn State and Oregon at the top of the total plays list. Those three played the most games. Ohio State won the national championship. Penn State made the national semifinals. Oregon played in the Big Ten title game and the Rose Bowl. So that doesn’t mean much.\nWhat’s more interesting? Rutgers is the next team up after those three. Rutgers did play in a bowl game last year, but went just 7-6. The averages will tell us a better story.\nWhen we look at what teams averaged the most plays, it’s a lot of mediocre teams at the top of the chart. Rutgers, Maryland and USC had the top three most plays per game. Those three teams combined to go 18-20 in 2024. Maryland won just won Big Ten game — against USC, ironically. So running a lot of plays didn’t necessarily mean a team was winning a lot of games based on 2024 data. The teams that were more successful (we’ll use the Big Ten teams that made the Playoff for the sake of this: Ohio State, Penn State, Oregon, Indiana) are scattered throughout this list. Ohio State had the fifth fewest plays of all Big Ten teams, and won the national championship.\nWhat we see here is that it’s not about the quantity of plays, but about executing each team’s respective style of play.\nDoes that change in 2025?\n\n\nCode\nb1g2025plays |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, totalplays), y = totalplays, fill = TeamFull)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#db7069\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total Plays by Big Ten Teams in 2025\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Total Plays\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, family = \"montserrat\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"), \n        axis.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nb1g2025plays |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, avgplays), y = avgplays, fill = TeamFull)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#db7069\") +\n  labs(title = \"Ohio State runs the fewest plays per game, and is the nation's best team\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Plays per game\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, family = \"montserrat\"),\n        axis.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total sum of plays is going to hold a bit more weight here because the season is ongoing in 2025 and teams have generally played the same number of games to this ponit in mid-October. Here, we see a mix of good and not so good teams here. Again, emphasizing our understanding that a quantity of plays doesn’t say much about a team other than just how it likes to play. Same thing goes for the average plays per game chart.\nIn both total plays and per game average, Ohio State is last in the Big Ten. Ohio State is also undefeated and the No. 1 team in the country. Seems like being slow isn’t slowing them down.\nWhich teams made the biggest changes from 2024 to 2025? Let’s visualize that.\n\n\nCode\ncombinedplays_long &lt;- combinedplays |&gt;\n  select(TeamFull, totalplays2024, totalplays2025) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"totalplays\"),\n    names_to = \"Year\",\n    values_to = \"TotalPlays\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Year = recode(Year,\n                  \"totalplays2024\" = \"2024\",\n                  \"totalplays2025\" = \"2025\"))\n\nggplot(combinedplays_long, aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, TotalPlays), y = TotalPlays, fill = Year)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_col(position = \"stack\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Big Ten Team Total Plays: 2024 vs 2025\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Total Plays\",\n    fill = \"Season\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n   plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\", family = \"montserrat\"),\n   axis.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"), \n   axis.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\")) +\n   scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"2024\" = \"#db7069\",  \n    \"2025\" = \"#2b6cb0\"  \n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncombinedplays |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt; \n  summarize(pct_change = ((avgplays2025 - avgplays2024) / avgplays2024) * 100) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(pct_change)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, pct_change), y = pct_change, fill = TeamFull)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"With a new coach, Purdue had the biggest jump in average plays per game this year.\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Percent Change in Plays per Game\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 9, face = \"bold\", family = \"montserrat\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"), \n    axis.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"), \n    legend.position = \"none\") +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Purdue Boilermakers\" = \"#647D4BFF\",  \n    \"Iowa Hawkeyes\" = \"#647D4BFF\",\n    \"Indiana Hoosiers\" = \"#647D4BFF\",\n    \"Northwestern Wildcats\" = \"#647D4BFF\",\n    \"Michigan Wolverines\" = \"#647D4BFF\",\n    \"Rutgers Scarlet Knights\" = \"#647D4BFF\",\n    \"Minnesota Golden Gophers\" = \"#647D4BFF\",\n    \"Michigan State Spartans\" = \"#647D4BFF\",\n    \"UCLA Bruins\" = \"#647D4BFF\",\n    \"Nebraska Cornhuskers\" = \"#647D4BFF\", \n    \"Oregon Ducks\" = \"#db7069\", \n    \"Illinois Fighting Illini\" = \"#db7069\",\n    \"Ohio State Buckeyes\" = \"#db7069\",\n    \"Penn State Nittany Lions\" = \"#db7069\",\n    \"Wisconsin Badgers\" = \"#db7069\",\n    \"USC Trojans\" = \"#db7069\",\n    \"Maryland Terrapins\" = \"#db7069\"\n  ))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurdue saw a jump of more than 20% in its average plays run per game from 2024 to 2025. What changed? A new a head coach. Purdue fired Ryan Walters after the 2024 season and hired Barry Odom. And while Purdue has at least outwardly appeared improved this year, notably hanging with Notre Dame for a bit, the Boilermakers are still just 2-4 and 0-3 in the Big Ten.\nThe style changed, but the result hasn’t yet. Which gets at another factor the plays data can’t show us: Purdue and other teams at the bottom of the Big Ten just aren’t talented enough.\nIt’s also worth noting that Iowa, IOWA!!!!, had the second largest increase in plays per game and yet……. they still aren’t good on offense! It’s at least a concerted effort to shift the narrative around what has been one of the nation’s most futile offenses, but the results have still been largely the same despite the higher speed of play.\nOn the flip side, Maryland has seen the largest decrease in plays per game, and is improved over last season, approaching bowl eligibility.\nHigh tempo offenses are often described as better offesnes in the media because they tend to create more highlights and score a lot of points. But running a lot of plays is clearly not a strong metric of deciding if an offense is good.\nIf you run 100 plays or three plays, what matters is that you score points. Scoring points wins football games. It doesn’t matter how you do it. A team’s efficiency and execution on offense within the sphere of their own scheme is a better determination of what makes a good team."

Ohio State has been the only other team worse than Maryland, still winless in Big Ten play.

Indiana makes sense to include since it employs Maryland’s former coach Steve Aird and we can compare how Maryland has fared under its new leadership. Nebraska is, well, Nebraska. Undefeated, No. 1 ranked in the country, all that stuff.\nSpoiler: Maryland doesn’t look so good here.\n\n\nCode\nvb_data |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Indiana\") |&gt; \n  summarize(total_kills = sum(kills), total_aces = sum(aces), total_opp_errors = sum(defensive_errors), total_solo_blocks = sum(block_solos))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  total_kills total_aces total_opp_errors total_solo_blocks\n        &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         644         76              281                27\n\n\nCode\niu &lt;- c(\"Kills\" = 597, \"Aces\" = 68, \"Opponent Errors\" = 258, \"Solo Blocks\" = 25)\n\nvb_data |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"Nebraska\") |&gt; \n  summarize(total_kills = sum(kills), total_aces = sum(aces), total_opp_errors = sum(defensive_errors), total_solo_blocks = sum(block_solos))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  total_kills total_aces total_opp_errors total_solo_blocks\n        &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         859         72              365                30\n\n\nCode\nne &lt;- c(\"Kills\" = 777, \"Aces\" = 60, \"Opponent Errors\" = 325, \"Solo Blocks\" = 24)\nmd_adjusted &lt;- c(\"Kills\" = 525, \"Aces\" = 72, \"Opponent Errors\" = 257, \"Solo Blocks\" = 13, 314)\niu_adjusted &lt;- c(\"Kills\" = 597, \"Aces\" = 68, \"Opponent Errors\" = 258, \"Solo Blocks\" = 25, 238)\n\n\n\niron(\n  waffle(\n  md_adjusted/2, \n  rows = 10, \n  title = \"How Maryland volleyball scores its points in 2025\",\n  xlab = \"1 square = 1 point\",\n  colors = c(\"black\", \"gold\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"white\")\n  ),\nwaffle(\n  iu_adjusted/2, \n  rows = 10, \n  title = \"How Indiana volleyball scores its points in 2025\",\n  xlab = \"1 square = 1 point\",\n  colors = c(\"black\", \"gold\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"white\")\n  ),\nwaffle(\n  ne/2,\n  rows = 10,\n  title = \"How Nebraska volleyball scores its points in 2025\",\n  xlab = \"1 square = 1 point\",\n  colors = c(\"black\", \"gold\", \"red\", \"blue\")\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, Nebraska is pretty impressive. Indiana has scored 81 more points than Maryland this season and the Hoosers are off to a good start in Big Ten play overall (at least relative to usual standard) and cracked the top 25 rankings. Indiana has a good margin over Maryland in kills, but other stats are pretty close. And that speaks a bit to how competitive the Big Ten is.\nBut wow that all pales in comparison to Nebraska. While Indiana has 81 points more than Maryland in total (which doesn’t feel like a large margin especially given a much larger difference in overall record), Nebraska has scored 314 more points, which is essentially another stratosphere relative to Maryland. Indiana is top four in the Big Ten right now, and Nebraska still has 238 more points than Aird’s team, too. That’s nuts.\nNebraska actually has the fewest aces of the three teams, but has been so noticeably better in kills and either forcing or profiting off opponent errors that it doesn’t matter. Nebraska’s size allows it to dominate on the court at a level of few other programs, and it does this annually.\nIt’s pretty visually obvious from these charts how far Maryland lags behind the leader of the conference. But that’s not a level Maryland has ever really competed at, and frankly there are only about a handful of teams in the country which can be at that level. This year, no one has been at Nebraska’s level as the Huskers are 16-0.\nInvestment in volleyball does indeed work!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Truly, with the amount of money that offensive coordinators get paid these days one might think that maybe, just maybe, they might be able to not get out of their own way on third downs. It seems like a near weekly occurrence than some play call is so mind mindbogglingly absurd that even a casual fan would be left confused.\nAre offensive coordinators stupid? Are we stupid? Are we all stupid?\nHere, we’re going to load in a dataset of every college football play before 2021 and 2025 and narrow it for specifically every third and six play to give a perfect medium distance that would leave an offensive coordinator with an actual choice to make. Let’s see what teams decided to do, and whether the person being made six-to-seven figures to call plays should keep doing it, or if it’s time to let the fan off his couch and into the booth.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncfbplays &lt;- load_cfb_pbp(seasons = 2021:2025)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nthirdandsix &lt;- cfbplays |&gt; \n  filter(down == 3 & distance == 6)\n\n\nWe’re going to look here at what the most common type of play is on third and six.\n\n\nCode\ntotal_running_plays &lt;- thirdandsix |&gt; \n  filter(play_type == \"Rush\") |&gt; \n  nrow()\n\nrun_play_pct &lt;- (total_running_plays/16447) * 100\n\ntotal_running_plays\n\n\n[1] 3362\n\n\nCode\nrun_play_pct\n\n\n[1] 20.44142\n\n\n\n\nCode\nthirdandsix |&gt; \n  group_by(play_type) |&gt;\n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n)) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 50) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(play_type, -n),  y = n, fill = play_type)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Turns out, college teams do indeed heavily rely on passing plays on third-and-medium\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Number of Plays\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy far, the most common play is a pass. Both completed passes and incomplete passes occur more frequently than rushes. That makes sense, third and six is a bit far for a running play. But that sure doesn’t stop offensive coordinators from calling them.\nAbout 20% of all third and six plays since 2021 have been rushes. Running on third and six seems a little bit nuts. Does it work at all?\n\n\nCode\nthirdandsix |&gt; \n  filter(play_type == \"Rush\") |&gt; \n  summarize(avg_yards = mean(yards_gained))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  avg_yards\n      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      5.69\n\n\nWell, that may explain why coordinators run the ball a noticeable amount on third and six! It does, occasionally, work. Teams average 5.7 yards gained when running the ball on this down and distance. That is, of course, less than six, but it is pretty close that running the ball may seem like a worth gamble. Especially given that there are more pass incompletions than rushing attempts at all, a rush may seem a little bit safer.\nA run on third down may also be getting close to the first down maker in these situation because defenses aren’t expecting it and are more focused on defending the pass. That can leave open running lanes.\nWhich teams do this the most?\n\n\nCode\nthirdandsix |&gt; \n  filter(play_type == \"Rush\") |&gt; \n  group_by(pos_team) |&gt; \n  summarize(rush_attempts = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(rush_attempts))\n\n\n# A tibble: 289 × 2\n   pos_team      rush_attempts\n   &lt;chr&gt;                 &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Army                     44\n 2 Navy                     39\n 3 Air Force                37\n 4 West Virginia            30\n 5 Baylor                   29\n 6 New Mexico               29\n 7 UNLV                     27\n 8 Michigan                 24\n 9 Ole Miss                 24\n10 Florida State            23\n# ℹ 279 more rows\n\n\nCode\n#cfbplays |&gt; filter(play_type == \"Rush\") |&gt; group_by(pos_team) |&gt; summarize(rush_attempts = n()) |&gt; arrange(desc(rush_attempts))\n\n\nWell well well, if it isn’t the service academies. Throughout the entire dataset regardless of it being third down or any down, Army, Navy and Air Force run the ball far more than any other team. So it makes quite a bit of sense to see these three teams at the top of the culprits running the ball on third down.\nBut it is interesting to see some teams that have become known for throwing the ball (ahem, Ole Miss) this far up the list. There are a group of schools at the bottom of this list that have run the ball on third and six just once. These are our favorite schools, a group of courageous ball knowers that like to have fun. We’re talking about you: Bentley, Bowie State (maryland schools!), Brown (fun nerds!), Bryant, Georgetown College Kentucky, Kentucky Christian, Laurinburg, Michigan Tech, Morehouse, New Haven, North Central College (pick a direction!), North Greenville, Post, Robert Morris, Shorter, Taylor (indiana schools!), Texas Wesleyan, Thomas More, Upper Iowa, Virginia State, Virginia U of Lynchburg (is that not just Liberty?), Webber U.\nNow the fun part (load groan): What is Maryland up to in this dataset?\n\n\nCode\nthirdandsix |&gt; \n  filter(pos_team == \"Maryland\") |&gt; \n  group_by(play_type) |&gt; \n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 2\n   play_type                      n\n   &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Pass Reception                27\n 2 Pass Incompletion             18\n 3 Rush                          17\n 4 Penalty                        6\n 5 Sack                           4\n 6 Timeout                        4\n 7 Passing Touchdown              2\n 8 Field Goal Good                1\n 9 Fumble Recovery (Opponent)     1\n10 Fumble Return Touchdown        1\n11 Interception Return            1\n12 Rushing Touchdown              1\n\n\nOver the course of the whole data set, Maryland’s play distribution basically lines up with the rest of the sport. Maryland certainly had a majority of passing plays, and its percentage of running plays relative to its total plays run is about the same 20% as the national average.\nAnd now let’s see how those numbers have changed year to year.\n\n\nCode\nthirdandsix |&gt; \n  filter(pos_team == \"Maryland\") |&gt; \n  group_by(year, play_type) |&gt; \n  summarize(n = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(year) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, color = play_type, group = play_type)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Maryland relied on the run often on third and six from 2021-2023\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Number of Plays\",\n    color = \"Play Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Maryland’s overall numbers are about in line with the national average, it has fluctuated a lot to get there. In 2021, 2022 AND 2023, Maryland ran the ball on third and six either just as much or more than any other play type. While we know the run CAN work, that is WAY too much running relative to the success rate of running on third-and-medium. Maryland largely reversed course in 2024 and this year with passing completions either tied for or leading the way each year.\nBut, over the course of the whole data set, Maryland averaged 6.12 yards on third and six, which may be enough to justify a pretty cowardly scheme.\n\n\nCode\nthirdandsix |&gt; \n  filter(pos_team == \"Maryland\" & play_type == \"Rush\") |&gt; \n  summarize(avg_yards = mean(yards_gained))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  avg_yards\n      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1      6.12\n\n\nSo what’s the takeaway here?\nMaybe offensive coordinators do know what they are doing. Is running the ball on third and six fun? No, no it is not. But national averages show the running can get close enough to the first down marker to make it worth the attempt. And, depending on the field position, running also could set up a very manageable fourth down if it does come up a bit short.\nAs fans, we want to see the flashy play. Sometimes flashy isn’t necessary. Just because a team throws the ball doesn’t mean they are going to air it out past the first down marker. Nor does it mean a big passing play makes sense. Six yards is not insignificant, but it also isn’t a distance to freak out and drop half the playbook over. The data backs that up."

    "section": "",
    "text": "College football coaches often predicate their philosophy on offense by establishing the run. The perception, largely, would be that when a team doesn’t run for many yards, they aren’t going to win the game.\nBut is that true? It might not be. Or at least it depends how a fan looks at it.\nSince 2015, there have been 867 instances of college football teams winning the game despite rushing for under 100 yards. That’s only about 5% of games. But in recent years, the number per season has been growing.\nBefore 2021, only one season (2017) saw more than 80 instances of a team winning with under 100 rushing yards. But from 2021-2024, that number has eclipsed 90 every year. In 2021, there it happened 104 times. In 2025, there are already 58 instances after roughly eight weeks of the season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(showtext)\nfont_add_google(\"Montserrat\", \"montserrat\")\nshowtext_auto()\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncfb_logs &lt;- read_csv(\"https://dwillis.github.io/sports-data-files/footballlogs1525.csv\")\n\n#how to calculate season: the season is the year of the game except when the game is in Jan, then it's year minus 1\ncfb_logs &lt;- cfb_logs |&gt; \n  mutate(season = case_when(\n    month(Date) == 1 ~ year(Date) - 1,\n    .default = year(Date)\n  ))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nseason_games &lt;- cfb_logs |&gt; \n  group_by(season) |&gt; \n  summarize(games = n()) \n\nseason_games_under_100_wins &lt;- cfb_logs |&gt; \n  filter(Result == \"W\", RushYds &lt; 100) |&gt; \n  group_by(season) |&gt;\n  summarize(low_rush_wins = n())\n\nseason_games_under_100_wins |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = low_rush_wins)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#db7069\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"College football teams are winning more games with under 100 rushing yards\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Number of wins\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10, family = \"montserrat\", margin = margin(b = 15)),\n    plot.title = element_textbox_simple(size = 16, family = \"montserrat\", face = \"bold\", margin = margin(b = 5)),\n    axis.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\", size = 8),\n    axis.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"),\n    legend.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\", size = 10),\n    plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what this means may not be as certain. There are two possible explanations.\nFirst, a team could just be getting lucky. There isn’t an overtly strong correlation between a high total of rushing yards and winning, but it does exist. Of course, getting more rushing yards can have an impact like wearing down the opponent. It certainly is better to have more than 100 rushing yards in a game. But a game has so many other breaks and key moments that rushing yards alone doesn’t explain the entirety of the game.\nSecond, teams just may be throwing the ball a bit more. With prolific quarterbacks becoming so highly sought after across the sport — and the ideal image of a hotshot offensive mind being based on the passing game — teams may not be choosing to or feeling they need to run the ball more often. A low rushing total doesn’t necessarily equate to a team having a bad day on offense. It could also mean they just acquired their yards a bit differently.\nThe Power Four conferences certainly had a decent share of these low-rushing yard wins. But the Big Ten is moving the opposoite way of these recent increases in winning with under 100 rushing yards.\n\n\nCode\ncombined_games &lt;- season_games |&gt; \n  inner_join(season_games_under_100_wins, join_by(season)) |&gt; \n  mutate((pct_low_rush_wins = low_rush_wins/games)*100)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#making the same dataframe but with just Big Ten teams\nb1g_season_games &lt;- cfb_logs |&gt; \n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\") |&gt; \n  group_by(season) |&gt; \n  summarize(games = n()) \n\nb1g_games_under_100_wins &lt;- cfb_logs |&gt; \n  filter(Result == \"W\", Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\", RushYds &lt; 100) |&gt; \n  group_by(season) |&gt;\n  summarize(low_rush_wins = n())\n\ncombined_b1g_games &lt;- b1g_season_games |&gt; \n  inner_join(b1g_games_under_100_wins, join_by(season)) |&gt; \n  mutate((pct_low_rush_wins = low_rush_wins/games)*100)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#comparing conferences\nconference_season_games &lt;- cfb_logs |&gt; \n  group_by(Conference, season) |&gt; \n  summarize(games = n())\n\nconference_under_100_wins &lt;- cfb_logs |&gt; \n  filter(Result == \"W\", RushYds &lt; 100) |&gt; \n  group_by(Conference, season) |&gt;\n  summarize(low_rush_wins = n())\n\nconference_combined_games &lt;- conference_season_games |&gt;\n  inner_join(conference_under_100_wins, join_by(Conference, season)) |&gt; \n  mutate(pct_low_rush_wins = (low_rush_wins/games)*100)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#lets graph that \nconference_combined_games |&gt; \n  filter(Conference %in% c(\"Big Ten Conference\", \"Southeastern Conference\", \"Atlantic Coast Conference\", \"Big 12 Conference\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(Conference = case_when(\n    Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\" ~ \"Big Ten\",\n    Conference == \"Southeastern Conference\" ~ \"SEC\",\n    Conference == \"Atlantic Coast Conference\" ~ \"ACC\",\n    Conference == \"Big 12 Conference\" ~ \"Big 12\",\n    TRUE ~ Conference\n  )) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = Conference, y = pct_low_rush_wins, fill = factor(season))) +\n  geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), width = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#8B4513\", \"#D2691E\", \"#CD853F\", \"#DEB887\", \"#F4A460\",\n                                \"#4682B4\", \"#6495ED\", \"#87CEEB\", \"#B0C4DE\", \"#5F9EA0\",\n                                \"#708090\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Big Ten teams seeing fewer wins with low rushing yards\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Wins with under 100 Rushing Yards\",\n    fill = \"Season\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size = 10, family = \"montserrat\", margin = margin(b = 15)),\n    plot.title = element_textbox_simple(size = 16, family = \"montserrat\", face = \"bold\", margin = margin(b = 5)),\n    axis.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\", size = 8),\n    axis.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(family = \"montserrat\"),\n    legend.title = element_text(family = \"montserrat\", size = 10),\n    plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2021 — the biggest year for teams winning with under 100 rushing yards — the Big Ten has had a pretty notable decline in these occurrences. The sport has seen a steady rate of seasons with over 90 wins across the sport with under 100 rushing yards, but the Big Ten has been trending for lower numbers each year.\nThe Big Ten is generally perceived as a run-first conference built on physical football. And maybe that’s why the Big Ten is seeing fewer of these wins with low rushing totals. The conference continues to run the ball well. Or, Big Ten teams are just generally playing better offense than the grind-it-out stereotype of the league would suggest.\nIt gets at the uncertainty on why these trends are occurring. Especially while the ACC goes the total opposite direction in the same time frame.\nBut while there are clear trends within this data, it circle back to an early point: this is just about 5% of all games since 2015. That’s an incredibly small piece. We can analyze trends within this segment and analyze why these occur. That’s important. It’s important to explain why, or understand why, these types of games occur. Even if the answer is unclear as it appaers to be here.\nBut if 95% of all games feature a team with more than 100 rushing yards, it becomes increasingly clear how valuable higher rushing totals may be."

The names of those schools are familiar and anticipated. Decidedly, Maryland isn’t one of them. Far from it, in fact. The schools that consistently reside at the top of the sport have several game performance metrics in common. Maryland isn’t anywhere close.\nSince the start of 2015, Maryland has been among the NCAA’s most mediocre teams in regard to its offensive and defensive yards per play output. Since the beginning of the 2015 season, Maryland is 54-71, a losing record. Its 54 wins are 92 out of 172 teams in a college football game logs data set — which does include the fact that teams which switched conferences since 2015 were counted twice. This is seen in the chart above with some labeled teams appearing twice. For example, Oklahoma’s smaller circle represents its SEC performance while the larger is the Big 12.\nThe chart above displays an overall over the entire time between 2015 and 2025 for Maryland’s position relative to the rest of college football programs in terms of offensive yards per play and defensive yards per play. In the chart, Maryland is right in the middle and clumped with among the most densely populated land of mediocrity in college football. Given the length of time this data covers, teams have the opportunities for regression toward a mean in the middle of the sport. There aren’t many teams who were truly terrible during this span of time, and there are only a handful of teams that were truly great.\nMaryland is average. So is most of the sport. Average, in Maryland’s case, means averaging 5.66 yards per play on offense and 5.49 yards per play on defense between 2015 and 2025 — with the 2025 data including games played as of Nov. 1. Both of those stats are outside the top 100 teams.\nComparatively, the most successful teams during that time span (Alabama, Ohio State, Georgia, Clemson, Oklahoma and Michigan to spotlight a few) are all clustered in a similar region of this chart — toward the bottom right which signifies both high offensive yards per play and low defensive yards per play. In other words, well rounded teams that perform well on both sides of the ball also tend to win a lot of games. This is success visualized: the best teams producing similar statistical outputs.\nOn the other end are the sports’ worst teams, like UMass. UMass (in multiple conferences) allows a ton of yards on defense and doesn’t produce many on offense. It’s why it’s consistently been among the worst teams in the country.\nMaryland is not in either quadrant. Maryland finds itself among the better half of average defense yards per play, but the worse half of offensive yards per play.\nLet’s look at this further, breaking Maryland down by season.\n\n\nCode\n#adding season column\ncfblogs &lt;- cfblogs |&gt; \n  mutate(season = ifelse(month(Date) == 1, \n                         year(Date) - 1, \n                         year(Date)))\n#update win/loss code\nwinlosslogs &lt;- cfblogs |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    wins = case_when(\n      grepl(\"W\", Outcome) ~ 1, \n      grepl(\"L\", Outcome) ~ 0)\n)\n\n#update to have by season data\nwinlosslogs |&gt;\n  group_by(Team, Conference, season) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    TotalPlays = sum(TotalPlays), \n    TotalYards = sum(TotalYds), \n    DefensivePlays = sum(DefTotalPlays), \n    DefensiveYards = sum(DefTotalYds), \n    TotalWins = sum(wins)) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    OffensiveYPP = TotalYards/TotalPlays, \n    DefensiveYPP = DefensiveYards/DefensivePlays) -&gt; byseasonypp\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Team', 'Conference'.

Maryland had four full-time head coaches during this time frame: the last year of Randy Edsall (which included a stint of Mike Locksley as the interim), then D.J. Durkin’s tenure, a year of Matt Canada and then Locksley since 2019.\nLocksley alone has had teams finish in all four of the above chart’s quadrants. He’s had teams that were among the upper half offensively including 2020, 2021 and 2023. The 2020 team averaged nearly 6.6 yards per play, but only played five games because of the pandemic season’s schedule. He’s also had some really poor defensive teams like his first team in 2019. The 2022 and 2023 teams — two of Maryland’s three bowl appearances (and wins) under Locksley — were Maryland’s two best defensive yards per play seasons for any coach since 2015. In 2021, the other Locksley bowl team, Maryland was strong enough offensively to overcome its second worst defensive defensive yards per play season during this time frame.\nThe only consistency, somewhat, was Durkin’s two teams (2016 and 2017) finishing with a somewhat similar statistical output. Obviously, there were significantly more important issues with his time at Maryland.\nWith so much year-by-year inconsistency, it’s no wonder Maryland has struggled to find sustained success. Two seasons finishing at 8-5 were Maryland’s best years in this set. It’s why the average of all the inconsistency puts Maryland right at the middle of the chart overall — mediocre. Maryland has had changing identities from year-to-year and hasn’t had much to rely on it.\nThe best programs don’t have these questions… like Alabama.\n\n\nCode\n#prepping alabama labels\nalabama_2015 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2015)\nalabama_2016 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2016)\nalabama_2017 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2017)\nalabama_2018 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2018)\nalabama_2019 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2019)\nalabama_2020 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2020)\nalabama_2021 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2021)\nalabama_2022 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2022)\nalabama_2023 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2023)\nalabama_2024 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2024)\nalabama_2025 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2025)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2015, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"gold\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2016, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2017, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2018, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n   data=alabama_2019, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2020, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2021, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2022, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2023, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2024, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2025, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.811255) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.562701) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2015, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2016, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2017, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2018, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2019, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2020, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2021, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2022, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2023, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2024, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2025, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  labs(title=\"Unlike Maryland, Alabama has an identity.\", subtitle=\"Alabama's year-by-year consistent performances and identity explain why it is college football's most successful program.\", caption= \"Source: NCAA | By Matt Cohen and mostly Derek Willis\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.caption = element_text(size=6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike Maryland, Alabama is consistent and has an identity. Every single Alabama team during this time frame finished in the quadrant with the best offensive yards per play output and and the best defensive yards per play output.\nAlabama’s three national championship winning teams since 2015 are marked above in gold. That includes its best overall team during the whole time frame: 2017. The 2015 and 2017 teams were two of Alabama’s best defensive teams and the 2020 team was its second best offensive team. That’s nit picking to an extent given how clearly elite every single Alabama team was during this time.\nMaryland is unlikely to ever hit a run like Alabama. But Alabama is seen as the standard and Locksley was hired from Alabama. There is a clear consistency displayed by the data that leads to winning. Maryland doesn’t have that. Nor is the inconsistency trending toward the best end of the spectrum enough to create many high moments for the program.\nMaryland has a lot of external hurdles to be a winner beyond just better on-field performance. Breaking out of mediocrity is incredibly difficult and its why so much of the sport lives in the land of mediocrity.\nBut it is possible.\n\n\nCode\nindiana_2015 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2015)\nindiana_2016 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2016)\nindiana_2017 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2017)\nindiana_2018 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2018)\nindiana_2019 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2019)\nindiana_2020 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2020)\nindiana_2021 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2021)\nindiana_2022 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2022)\nindiana_2023 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2023)\nindiana_2024 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2024)\nindiana_2025 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2025)\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2015, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2016, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2017, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2018, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n   data=indiana_2019, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2020, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2021, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2022, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2023, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2024, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2025, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.811255) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.562701) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2015, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2016, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2017, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2018, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2019, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2020, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2021, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2022, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2023, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2024, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2025, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  labs(title=\"Indiana shows that just about anyone can get better, with the right circumstances\", subtitle=\"\", caption= \"Source: NCAA | By Matt Cohen and mostly Derek Willis\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.caption = element_text(size=6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above chart shows Indiana, a usually annually reliable doormat nationally. And for the most part during the time span here, Indiana was terrible! It consistently showed to be worse than medicore. And the team’s overall record followed suit.\nThat changed with the right coaching staff putting together the right roster. With Curt Cignetti, Indiana has vaulted itself with two statistically elite seasons in 2024 and thus far in 2025, very similar (if not better) outputs than Alabama. It’s why Indiana is ranked No. 2 in the country.\nSo if the program with the most losses in the history of the sport can do it, so can Maryland. Someone might just have to be beg Kevin Plank to write a bigger check."

The names of those schools are familiar and anticipated. Decidedly, Maryland isn’t one of them. Far from it, in fact. The schools that consistently reside at the top of the sport have several game performance metrics in common. Maryland isn’t anywhere close.\nSince the start of 2015, Maryland has been among the NCAA’s most mediocre teams in regard to its offensive and defensive yards per play output. Since the beginning of the 2015 season, Maryland is 54-71, a losing record. Its 54 wins are 92 out of 172 teams in a college football game logs data set — which does include the fact that teams which switched conferences since 2015 were counted twice. This is seen in the chart above with some labeled teams appearing twice. For example, Oklahoma’s smaller circle represents its SEC performance while the larger is the Big 12.\nThe chart above displays an overall over the entire time between 2015 and 2025 for Maryland’s position relative to the rest of college football programs in terms of offensive yards per play and defensive yards per play. In the chart, Maryland is right in the middle and clumped with among the most densely populated land of mediocrity in college football. Given the length of time this data covers, teams have the opportunities for regression toward a mean in the middle of the sport. There aren’t many teams who were truly terrible during this span of time, and there are only a handful of teams that were truly great.\nMaryland is average. So is most of the sport. Average, in Maryland’s case, means averaging 5.66 yards per play on offense and 5.49 yards per play on defense between 2015 and 2025 — with the 2025 data including games played as of Nov. 1. Both of those stats are outside the top 100 teams.\nComparatively, the most successful teams during that time span (Alabama, Ohio State, Georgia, Clemson, Oklahoma and Michigan to spotlight a few) are all clustered in a similar region of this chart — toward the bottom right which signifies both high offensive yards per play and low defensive yards per play. In other words, well rounded teams that perform well on both sides of the ball also tend to win a lot of games. This is success visualized: the best teams producing similar statistical outputs.\nOn the other end are the sports’ worst teams, like UMass. UMass (in multiple conferences) allows a ton of yards on defense and doesn’t produce many on offense. It’s why it’s consistently been among the worst teams in the country.\nMaryland is not in either quadrant.

Maryland had four full-time head coaches during this time frame: the last year of Randy Edsall (which included a stint of Mike Locksley as the interim), then D.J. Durkin’s tenure, a year of Matt Canada and then Locksley since 2019.\nLocksley alone has had teams finish in all four of the above chart’s quadrants. He’s had teams that were among the upper half offensively including 2020, 2021 and 2023. The 2020 team averaged nearly 6.6 yards per play, but only played five games because of the pandemic season’s schedule. He’s also had some really poor defensive teams like his first team in 2019. The 2022 and 2023 teams — two of Maryland’s three bowl appearances (and wins) under Locksley — were Maryland’s two best defensive yards per play seasons for any coach since 2015. In 2021, the other Locksley bowl team, Maryland was strong enough offensively to overcome its second worst defensive defensive yards per play season during this time frame.\nThe only consistency, somewhat, was Durkin’s two teams (2016 and 2017) finishing with a somewhat similar statistical output. Obviously, there were significantly more important issues with his time at Maryland.\nWith so much year-by-year inconsistency, it’s no wonder Maryland has struggled to find sustained success. Two seasons finishing at 8-5 were Maryland’s best years in this set. It’s why the average of all the inconsistency puts Maryland right at the middle of the chart overall — mediocre. Maryland has had changing identities from year-to-year and hasn’t had much to rely on it.\nThe best programs don’t have these questions… like Alabama.\n\n\nCode\n#prepping alabama labels\nalabama_2015 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2015)\nalabama_2016 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2016)\nalabama_2017 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2017)\nalabama_2018 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2018)\nalabama_2019 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2019)\nalabama_2020 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2020)\nalabama_2021 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2021)\nalabama_2022 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2022)\nalabama_2023 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2023)\nalabama_2024 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2024)\nalabama_2025 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Alabama\", season == 2025)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2015, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"gold\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2016, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2017, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2018, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n   data=alabama_2019, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2020, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"gold\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2021, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2022, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2023, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2024, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=alabama_2025, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.811255) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.562701) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2015, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2016, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2017, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2018, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2019, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2020, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2021, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2022, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2023, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2024, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=alabama_2025, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  labs(title=\"Unlike Maryland, Alabama has an identity.\", subtitle=\"Alabama's year-by-year consistent performances and identity explain why it is college football's most successful program.\", caption= \"Source: NCAA | By Matt Cohen and mostly Derek Willis\", x = \"Offensive yards per play\", y = \"Defensive yards per play\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.caption = element_text(size=6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike Maryland, Alabama is consistent and has an identity. Every single Alabama team during this time frame finished in the quadrant with the best offensive yards per play output and and the best defensive yards per play output.\nAlabama’s three national championship winning teams since 2015 are marked above in gold. That includes its best overall team during the whole time frame: 2017. The 2015 and 2017 teams were two of Alabama’s best defensive teams and the 2020 team was its second best offensive team. That’s nit picking to an extent given how clearly elite every single Alabama team was during this time.\nMaryland is unlikely to ever hit a run like Alabama. But Alabama is seen as the standard and Locksley was hired from Alabama. There is a clear consistency displayed by the data that leads to winning. Maryland doesn’t have that. Nor is the inconsistency trending toward the best end of the spectrum enough to create many high moments for the program.\nMaryland has a lot of external hurdles to be a winner beyond just better on-field performance. Breaking out of mediocrity is incredibly difficult and its why so much of the sport lives in the land of mediocrity.\nBut it is possible.\n\n\nCode\nindiana_2015 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2015)\nindiana_2016 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2016)\nindiana_2017 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2017)\nindiana_2018 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2018)\nindiana_2019 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2019)\nindiana_2020 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2020)\nindiana_2021 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2021)\nindiana_2022 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2022)\nindiana_2023 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2023)\nindiana_2024 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2024)\nindiana_2025 &lt;- byseasonypp |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indiana\", season == 2025)\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2015, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2016, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2017, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2018, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n   data=indiana_2019, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2020, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2021, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2022, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2023, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2024, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=indiana_2025, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.811255) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.562701) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2015, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2016, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2017, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2018, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2019, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2020, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2021, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2022, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2023, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2024, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=indiana_2025, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label= season)\n  ) + \n  labs(title=\"Indiana shows that just about anyone can get better, with the right circumstances\", subtitle=\"Maryland might not compare to Alabama, but it certainly can to Indiana.\", x = \"Offensive yards per play\", y = \"Defensive yards per play\", caption= \"Source: NCAA | By Matt Cohen and mostly Derek Willis\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8), \n    plot.caption = element_text(size=6),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above chart shows Indiana, a usually annually reliable doormat nationally. And for the most part during the time span here, Indiana was terrible! It consistently showed to be worse than medicore. And the team’s overall record followed suit.\nThat changed with the right coaching staff putting together the right roster. With Curt Cignetti, Indiana has vaulted itself with two statistically elite seasons in 2024 and thus far in 2025, very similar (if not better) outputs than Alabama. It’s why Indiana is ranked No. 2 in the country.\nSo if the program with the most losses in the history of the sport can do it, so can Maryland. Someone might just have to be beg Kevin Plank to write a bigger check."

But it would be pretty hard for the Colts to improve at all with an already absurdly high-scoring offense.\nThrough nine weeks, the Colts have a total redzone EPA of 31.94 over 112 plays inside the 20 yard line. Only the Kansas City Chiefs have run more plays in the red zone, but the Chiefs EPA is nearly 25 points below the Colts.\nStrictly based on points per game, the Colts are the best team in the NFL by roughly two points. Indianapolis is the only team averaging more than 30 points per game at this point in the season. It makes a lot of sense given how often the Colts have been in redzone, and how often the Colts have taken advantage of their opportunities — all while being incredibly consistent in doing so as shown by their EPA in the redzone after three games and again after nine games only differed by 0.6 points.\nOn the other end of the spectrum are the New York Giants. Through the first three weeks, the Giants were in the upper half of the league in EPA in the redzone.\nEverything has been horrible since. The Giants were at total EPA of about 1 in the redzone through Week 3. Through Week 9? The Giants are now -32.17. It’s a truly staggering falloff, especially for a team that had seemed, at least from the surface, to be playing better with a rookie quarterback.\nThe Giants have also been in the redzone far less frequently. Through the first three weeks, the Giants ran 45 plays in the redzone. In the six weeks to follow, the Giants ran just 50 plays in the redzone. It is hard to create a good EPA in the redzone when you aren’t getting there at all.\nLargely, it does seem that having a strong redzone EPA does lend itself to being a better team. The 10 teams with the best EPAs through nine weeks are the Colts, Broncos, Lions, Commanders, Bengals, Eagles, Steelers, Bills, Packers and Jets. Seven of those teams are likely going to the playoffs.\nBut redzone EPA also doesn’t explain everything about a team. The Commanders have been good in the redzone so far, but have had instability at quarterbacks and appear likely to have lost Jayden Daniels for the long term. The Bengals have actually improved their redzone EPA since losing starting quarterback Joe Burrow. The Jets are, well, the Jets and are somehow still in the top 10. Similarly, most of the NFL’s most struggling teams are at the bottom of the chart.\nThe NFL has also been incredibly varied in terms of sustained redzone performance. There are several teams (most of which clustered toward the top of the chart) which have seen significant improvement in their redzone EPAs since Week 3. But there are also a little under half the teams which have barely changed their performance at all. Sometimes, using the Chiefs as an example, it is hard to break out of a specific flaw a team has, especially with so few games and opportunities to do so."

Six Maryland players are averaging better than that (among those with at least five games played). Among those six are players from Maryland’s sophomore, junior and senior classes. Maryland has two freshman that are just below the national average, too, in Rocket Ritarita and Henry Bernstein. Ritarita is also among Maryland’s top six players in total shots on goal.\nSophomore Stephane Njike has been one of Maryland’s most productive offensive players. He’s second on the team in goals scored and goals per game. He’s been the best Terp for shots on goal per game. His scoring has been elite among sophomores nationally (15th among all sophomores in goals per game), but also for any class. Njike is 55th nationally in goals per game among all players.\nThough while Maryland has gotten production from its underclassmen to balance its seniors, the experienced players have led the way.\nSenior Sadam Masereka is 27th nationally in goals per game and 13th among seniors.\nMaryland’s production is among the best in the Big Ten. As of Nov. 12, four Big Ten teams are ranked in the top 25 polls: Maryland, Michigan, Washington and Indiana. Among those teams, Maryland has two players who are averaging better than 0.5 goals per game. The other three have one player, combined.\n\n\nCode\nindiana &lt;- \n  shooters |&gt;\n  filter(\n    team == \"Indiana Hoosiers\" & \n      goals_avg &gt; .1665)\n\nmichigan &lt;- \n  shooters |&gt;\n  filter(\n    team == \"Michigan Wolverines\" & \n      goals_avg &gt; .1665)\n\nwashington &lt;- \n  shooters |&gt;\n  filter(\n    team == \"Washington Huskies\" & \n      goals_avg &gt; .1665)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=shooters, \n    aes(x=yr, y=goals_avg), \n    color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=md_volume_shooters, \n    aes(x=yr, y=goals_avg), \n    color=\"black\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=indiana, \n    aes(x=yr, y=goals_avg), \n    color=\"red\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=washington, \n    aes(x=yr, y=goals_avg), \n    color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=michigan, \n    aes(x=yr, y=goals_avg), \n    color=\"yellow\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Of top Big Ten teams, Maryland has the most high volume scorers\",\n    subtitle = \"Among ranked Big Ten programs, three players are averaging better than 0.5 goals per game.

That’s the second best rate in the country. Ault is the nation’s top scorer with 16 goals.\nBut among ranked Big Ten teams, Masereka and Njike are second and third, respectively, in goals per game. Of these four teams, there are 26 players who who are above the national average in goals per game. Washington has a plurality of those players with eight. Maryland, Indiana and Michigan each have six.\nAs a team, Indiana is the top scoring unit in the Big Ten and the third best nationally. But having elite scoring isn’t enough on its own. Indiana failed to make the four-team Big Ten Tournament. UCLA, which is barely inside the top 100 nationally in total goals, did.\nAnd UCLA beat Maryland 2-0 on Wednesday in College Park in the first round of the Big Ten Tournament.\nOf the four ranked Big Ten teams, only Washington a freshman, sophomore, junior and senior appearing above the national average in goals per game. Washington also has the most underclassmen among the teams with three sophomores and one freshman. Maryland, Michigan and Indiana have three underclassmen combined.\nSo while Maryland has seen some high end production from an underclassmen in Njike, it’s still the upperclassmen leading the way compared to its other Big Ten counterparts. All four of these Big Ten teams are prepared beyond the 2025 season, but both Maryland and Indiana will need to replace the two best scoring threats among the Big Ten’s top teams. Maryland has a seemingly ready-made fit in Njike.\nMaryland’s question beyond that is if an underclassmen that is showing promise will take the next step into production mirroring Njike."

And yet, it didn’t change the game’s ultimate result.\nAgainst Indiana, Maryland rushed for 37 yards on 17 attempts, or 2.2 yards per carry. The Terps lost that game 55-10. Against Rutgers the next week, Maryland had a 377.3% increase in yards per carry up to 10.5 yards per carry on 29 attempts. It was Maryland’s best rushing average, well, ever.\nMaryland itself reported the mark tied a previous single-game program record set in 1950. Maryland beat Virginia Tech that day 63-7. Virginia Tech went 0-10 that season. This was also the first time Maryland went over 300 rushing yards as a team since 2019 and the most rushing yards it had in a Big Ten game since 2018.\nBut Maryland STILL lost to Rutgers 35-20. In other words, Maryland had a record-setting rushing performance and lost by 15 points.\nHow is that possible?\nIt’s somewhat simple: Maryland’s defense was horrible. Maryland’s rushing defense in general has been quite poor this year. Its allowing 165.9 rushing yards per game. That’s worse than Purdue, Northern Illinois, Akron, Southern Miss and Syracuse. Against Rutgers, Maryland allowed 256 rushing yard, and another 229 through the air. Maryland had 403 yards of offense for the game and still was out-gained by 82 yards. While freshman quarterback Malik Washington had 164 rushing yards (including a 73-yard touchdown run), he only passed for 98 yards on 28 attempts and threw an interception.\nMaryland’s performance against Indiana can be excused to an extent. The Hoosiers have the sixth best rushing defense in the country, and its performance against Maryland was the second fewest yards per carry it allowed against a power conference opponent this season. But Indiana has won so many games by such massive margins that many of its opponents have had to abandon the run entirely. Indiana has held eight of ten teams its played under 100 rushing yards. While Maryland’s rushing performance against Indiana was bad, it could always be worse. Illinois managed two rushing yards against Indiana in a 53-point loss. Not two yards per carry, but just two yards. Total.\nEven in that context, it’s still Maryland’s game against Rutgers that is the anomaly for its rushing offense, not the Indiana game. Maryland is the third worst team in the Big Ten this year in rushing yards per game.\n\n\nCode\nbigten |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    RushYds = mean(RushYds)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(RushYds) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n    geom_col(\n      aes(x = reorder(Team, RushYds), y = RushYds, fill = Team == \"Maryland\")\n    ) +\n    scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"red\", \"FALSE\" = \"gray70\")) +\n    coord_flip() +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Only Wisconsin and Minnesota have fewer rushing yards per game than Maryland\",\n      x = \"\",\n      y = \"Rushing yards per game\"\n   ) +\n   theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n     legend.position = \"none\",\n     plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = \"bold\")\n   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRutgers defense has been extremely poor this season which should have provided a necessary bounce-back. Rutgers also allowed Oregon to go about 11 (ELEVEN!) yards per carry earlier this season. To get back to a bowl game, that was a game Maryland essentially had to win. At minimum, it needed a confidence boost after the 45-point loss at home on homecoming to Indiana.\nMaryland has now lost five consecutive games after starting 4-0. To reach a bowl game, it must win two out of three games against Illinois, Michigan and Michigan State. Michigan and Illinois are both comfortable favorites against Maryland.\nWhat has caused Maryland’s season to spiral?\nBefore its historic but unfruitful rushing performance against Rutgers, Maryland had had been consistently under the Big Ten average in rushing yards per attempt. What’s been equally poor is Maryland’s rush defense. Albeit against lesser competition, Maryland only allowed one team to eclipse 100 rushing yards during its 4-0 start. Since then? Maryland has allowed nearly 225 rushing yards per game. That’s the second worst mark among Power 4 teams and sixth worst nationally of any team after its first four games.\nThe only power conference team worse than Maryland is Rutgers. And the Terps couldn’t even take advantage of that.\n\n\nCode\nlogs |&gt; \n  filter(Gtm &gt; 4) |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    avg_rush_def = mean(DefRushYds)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(avg_rush_def))\n\n\n# A tibble: 136 × 2\n   Team             avg_rush_def\n   &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Sam Houston              251.\n 2 Charlotte                242.\n 3 North Texas              228.\n 4 Florida Atlantic         227.\n 5 Rutgers                  226.\n 6 Maryland                 225.\n 7 Colorado                 222.\n 8 Colorado State           213.\n 9 Nevada-Las Vegas         212.\n10 Georgia State            211 \n# ℹ 126 more rows"

That’s because offense typically requires learning more plays and positioning, and it takes players more time to get off the shooting rust from an off season.\nBut not at Maryland, and not under the first four games of Buzz Williams’ tenure. The Terps are allowing nearly two points more per game than any of its previous Novembers since the 2014-15 season. It’s the worst defensive start to a season in a decade in College Park. Power conference programs often play several cupcakes in November to work on putt the pieces together. It usually wins those games in a blowout.\nOn average, Maryland isn’t doing that either so far.\n\n\nCode\nearlyterps |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    point_dif = TeamScore - OpponentScore\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    avg_point_dif = mean(point_dif)\n  ) |&gt;\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x=Season, y=avg_point_dif), fill=\"darkred\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Maryland's average margin of victory in November is down\",\n    subtitle = \"Under Buzz Williams, Maryland is winning by fewer points than most Novembers.\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Average Margin of Victory\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"poppins\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative to other November performances, Maryland isn’t reaching a double-digit margin of victory. Maryland lost by 10 at home to Georgetown, won a close game against Marquette and while it had more comfortable margins against Alcorn State and Coppin State neither game was as much of a blowout as previous Maryland teams have reached — especially as Maryland’s defense allowed more than 60 points to both Alcorn and Coppin State, No. 344 and No. 364 in KenPom respectively.\nYet, Maryland’s defensive rating according to KenPom is in the top 20 nationally. While it’s been a poor performance for Maryland relative to previous Novembers, Maryland has stood up fairly well relative to its competitors.\n\n\nCode\nsumlogs &lt;- logs |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2025-2026\") |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    games = n(),\n    wins = sum(W_L == \"W\"),\n    losses = sum(W_L == \"L\"),\n    points_for = sum(TeamScore),\n    points_against = sum(OpponentScore),\n    TeamFGPCT = mean(TeamFGPCT, na.rm = TRUE),\n    OpponentFGPCT = mean(OpponentFGPCT, na.rm = TRUE),\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    point_dif = points_for - points_against,\n    win_pct = wins / games,\n    avg_points_for = points_for / games,\n    avg_points_against = points_against / games\n  ) \n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = sumlogs, aes(x = avg_points_for, y = avg_points_against), color = \"gray\") +\n  geom_point(data = sumlogs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Maryland\"), aes(x = avg_points_for, y = avg_points_against), color = \"red\", size = 3) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = sumlogs |&gt; filter(Team == \"Maryland\"), aes(x = avg_points_for, y = avg_points_against, label = Team), family = \"poppins\", size = 4) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"But relative to its compeittors, Maryland defensive struggles are misleading\",\n    subtitle = \"This may be Maryland's worst November defensively in a decade.

Whether Maryland’s internal stats comparison has to do with a new coach is unclear, but most teams in the country are struggling more than Maryland.\nYet while a change in coach can lead to Maryland have a notable change in it’s defensive performance, Maryland’s shooting as a team has been inconsistent over the last decade no matter who was on the sideline. It is hard to maintain offensive consistency early in a season as a team learns to gel together. Maryland’s team shooting percentages have been a bit all over the place.\n\n\nCode\ntop_opps &lt;- c(\"Villanova\", \"Marquette\", \"Butler\", \"Georgetown\", \"Virginia\", \"Pitt\", \"Louisville\", \"Kansas State\", \"Syracuse\", \"Miami (FL)\")\n\ngoodprograms &lt;- earlyterps  |&gt; \n  mutate(Power4_BigEast = Opponent %in% top_opps) |&gt; \n  filter(Power4_BigEast == TRUE)\n\ngoodwins &lt;- goodprograms |&gt; \n  filter(W_L == \"W\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(data=earlyterps, aes(x=Season, y=TeamFGPCT), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=goodprograms, aes(x=Season, y=TeamFGPCT), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=goodprograms, aes(x=Season, y=TeamFGPCT, label=Opponent), size=3, nudge_x = 0.2, family = \"poppins\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Early in the year, Maryland's shooting has been inconsistent\",\n    subtitle = \"Maryland's games against Power 4 and Big East teams are highlighted.\",\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Field Goal Percentage\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"poppins\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Maryland tries to figure out how to run its offense and get a shooting grove going early in the year, it’s understandably experienced a lot of highs and lows. This year, Maryland’s home loss to Georgetown served as one of the lowest lows. Maryland has variable in both its games against major conference opponents and the Big East as well as its games against cupcake teams.\nMaryland’s 18-point 2022 win over Miami (FL) was arguably its best November shooting performance considering quality of opponent. Maryland reached 60% shooting as a team in that win. On the other end is shooting 24% and managing just 40 points in a 2023 loss to Villanova. That was then-future and now-current Villanova Head Coach Kevin Willard’s first year at Maryland.\nThere is not clear predictor of how the rest of a season will go based on Maryland’s early season shooting. The best mark may be looking at where Maryland bottomed out.\nMaryland shot better than 40% as a team in ever November game during the 2015-16, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2020-21, 2022-23 and 2024-25 seasons. It went on to make the NCAA Tournament in all but one of those seasons. In the 2016-17, 2021-22 and 2023-24 seasons, Maryland had three games each shooting below 40% in November. Only the 2016-17 team made the NCAA Tournament, and lost in the first round to Xavier. The data does not include Maryland’s 2019-20 team, which was arguably its best team in this time span. But Maryland did shoot above 40% every November game that year and was on track for a strong NCAA Tournament seed before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic."
