We here at this publication dedicated to whatever Derek assigned me to do this week are committed to impactful journalism with complete and utter objectivity.\nBut the author of this post did attend Indiana University for his undergrad years, and may have a bit of a soft spot for this specific dataset which is just 2024 and 2025 data and — as of writing this post before Indiana plays Oregon this weekend — this is undoubtedly the most incredible stretch of Indiana football success in the history of the program. It isn’t even close for the team with the most losses in the history of the sport at a Division I level. So given the rare opportunity we have to discuss Hoosier football glory, let’s see just how good Indiana has been relative to a league that has produced the last two national champions and three of the last four teams to play in the national title game (Indiana beat two of those teams during the span of this dataset).\nOkay maybe this is actually a fan blog.\nLet’s look first at which Big Ten teams had the best scoring offenses in each of the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Let’s start with 2024. And yes, I made sure to check Indiana’s branding guide for the correct crimson color hex code.\n\n\nCode\nbigten2024 |&gt; \n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt; \n  summarize(points_per_game = mean(Points, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(points_per_game)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, points_per_game), y = points_per_game)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#990000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Indiana leads Big Ten scoring offenses in 2024... by a lot\", subtitle = \"Five Big Ten surpassed 30 point per game averages in the 2024 season.

That’s the clear leader among Big Ten teams (for what it’s worth, that was also second best nationally behind Miami — and nothing at all went wrong for Miami in 2024 obviously!). The next closest is Ohio State at 35.69. That’s certainly a notable gap!\nShould we mention that Ohio State still beat Indiana and went on to win the national championship? I guess that’s probably important to note that scoring a lot of points doesn’t make you the BEST team. But it doesn’t hurt!\nNow let’s look at 2025. What changed, if anything?\n\n\nCode\nbigten2025 |&gt; \n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt; \n  summarize(points_per_game = mean(Points, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(points_per_game)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(TeamFull, points_per_game), y = points_per_game)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#990000\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"New faces join the Big Ten's top scoring offenses.\", subtitle = \"USC currently leads the Big Ten in scoring offense, but some less regarded teams like Nebraska have made big surges in 2025 compared to a season ago.

Granted, most of the games played are still non-conference games so we can’t really compare that number too much given the higher unbalanced sample size of cupcake games relative to power conference opponents.\nSo let’s check that out.\n\n\nCode\nb1g2025ptsavg &lt;- bigten2025 |&gt; \n  summarize(avgpts = mean(Points, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  pull(avgpts)\n\nadjustedb1g2024ptsavg &lt;- bigten2024 |&gt; filter(Gtm &lt;= 5) |&gt; \n  summarize(avgpts = mean(Points, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  pull(avgpts)\n\nadjusted_pct_change &lt;- ((b1g2025ptsavg-adjustedb1g2024ptsavg)/adjustedb1g2024ptsavg)*100\n\navg_data &lt;- tibble(\n  Year = c(2024, 2025),\n  Average = c(adjustedb1g2024ptsavg, b1g2025ptsavg)\n)\n\nggplot(avg_data, aes(x = factor(Year), y = Average, group = 1)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#990000\", linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, color = \"#990000\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Even with adjusted data, scoring is still up in 2025\",\n    subtitle = \"Through the first five games of both the 2024 and 2025 seasons, this year's average scoring in the Big Ten is up by about five points per game.\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Average Points\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n  axis.title = element_text(size = 6, family = \"montserrat\", face = \"bold\"),\n    title = element_text(size = 13, family = \"montserrat\", face=\"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = \"montserrat\", size = 9, face = \"plain\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(family = \"montserrat\", size = 8, face = \"italic\"),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 6, family = \"montserrat\", face = \"bold\"),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurns out scoring is still up over the first games of the season (balanced where being five games into the 2025 season), but quite a bit less than 27%. 17.4% is still a pretty big jump in scoring through.\nAnd Indiana is still second in the Big Ten. The Hoosiers are scoring 47.8 points per game so far, less than a point behind Big Ten leaders USC."
